        <p><span class="orange_large">Picky Eater</span> was developed as a means to keep track of the items you have available in your pantry, as
            well as a way to find your child's favorite recipes based on the items they love. We understand that, <span class="franklin_navy_large">sometimes</span>, a child (<span class="pacifico_small_orange">and maybe even yourself..</span>) can be a bit.. <span class="italics">picky</span>.</p>
            <p>So, we designed our program with both you and your children in mind; whether you're a parent, babysitter, daycare guardian or just somebody looking for recipe ideas, Picky Eater should have you covered.</p>
